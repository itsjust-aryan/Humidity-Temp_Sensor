# Humidity-Temp_Sensor

**Introduction:**
Modern society faces unprecedented challenges due to the intensification of industrial and 
urban activities, resulting in a substantial impact on both weather conditions and air 
quality. Traditional monitoring systems often fall short in providing scalable, accessible, 
and cost-effective solutions. This project harnesses the power of IoT, employing the 
NodeMCU module (ESP8266) alongside DHT11 and MQ-135 sensors for weather 
monitoring and gas sensing respectively, to create an adaptable and scalable system for 
continuous environmental monitoring.

**Motivation:**
The motivation stems from the critical need to establish a comprehensive, real-time 
monitoring solution capable of understanding and managing environmental variables. 
Existing systems often lack the flexibility and cost-effectiveness required for widespread 
implementation. This project is motivated by the potential to democratize access to 
environmental data, empowering communities, researchers, and policymakers with timely 
and accurate information to formulate strategies for mitigating environmental impacts.

**Problem Definition:**
Current environmental monitoring systems lack a cost-effective and scalable solution for 
real-time weather and air quality assessment at the local level. There is a need for a userfriendly system that provides immediate access to accurate data on temperature, humidity, 
and air quality parameters. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a Weather and 
Air Quality Monitoring System using NodeMCU (ESP8266) with DHT11 and MQ-135 
gas sensors, integrated with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and alerts.

**Objectives:**
➢ Real-Time Weather Monitoring: Implement a robust system capable of 
monitoring temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor, providing crucial 
insights into local weather patterns.
➢ Air Quality Assessment: Utilize the MQ-135 gas sensor to measure 
concentrations of various air pollutants, including carbon dioxide and other 
harmful gases, offering a comprehensive assessment of air quality.
➢ IoT Integration: Leverage the NodeMCU (ESP8266) module for seamless data 
transmission to a centralized server via Wi-Fi connectivity, ensuring real-time 
access to environmental data.
➢ Data Visualization: Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface to visualize 
the collected data, employing charts and graphs to enhance accessibility and 
comprehension for a diverse user base.

**Methodology:**
1. Hardware Setup: Configure DHT11 and MQ-135 sensors with NodeMCU (ESP8266) 
for precise data collection, ensuring meticulous wiring and reliable power supply.
2. Programming: Develop firmware for NodeMCU to read sensor data and transmit it 
securely to a cloud server using Wi-Fi connectivity.
3. Cloud Integration: Establish a secure cloud server to receive, store, and manage the 
continuous stream of environmental data from distributed sensors.
4. Data Analysis: Implement algorithms for real-time data analysis to extract meaningful 
insights into weather conditions and air quality parameters.
5. User Interface: Design an intuitive web-based or mobile interface for users to visualize 
environmental data through charts and graphs.
